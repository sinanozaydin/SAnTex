	abstract = {We review the physical basis of the development of fabrics in plastic and viscous flow and illustrate the typical fabrics formed by these processes in the main rock-forming silicates of the lower crust (feldspar, quartz, pyroxene and amphibole). The orientation process in plastic deformation where a single slip is dominant is recalled and the role of the constraint of neighbouring grains is emphasized. The fabric development of anisometric crystals in viscous flow is discussed as a function of the main controlling parameters: shear strain, aspect ratio and interference between crystals. The same sense of fabric asymmetry is introduced by plastic and viscous flow between the flow plane and the shape preferred orientation and hence coherent kinematic analysis can be undertaken in both modes of flow. In order to assess the role of such fabrics in the seismic laminations of the lower continental crust we have calculated the seismic P-wave properties of typical fabrics for hypothetical monomineralic and polymineralic rocks. The calculations show that the strongest anisotropies develop in monomineralic rock with values between 5 and 16\%, compared with 5 and 8\% for typical rock compositions. The strongest anisotropies for layered monomineralic rocks generated by fabrics is only 6\% compared to the 14\% suggested by model studies of the observed seismic laminations. We suggest that other effects, such as compositional layering and/or constructive interference of seismic waves are responsible for augmenting the apparent anisotropy.},

	abstract = {Initiation of partial melting in the mid/lower crust causes a decrease in P wave and S wave velocities; recent studies imply that the relationship between these velocities and melt is not simple. We have developed a modeling approach to assess the combined impact of various melt and solid phase properties on seismic velocities and anisotropy. The modeling is based on crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) data measured from migmatite samples, allowing quantification of the variation of seismic velocities with varying melt volumes, shapes, orientations, and matrix anisotropy. The results show nonlinear behavior of seismic properties as a result of the interaction of all of these physical properties, which in turn depend on lithology, stress regime, strain rate, preexisting rock fabrics, and pressure-temperature conditions. This nonlinear behavior is evident when applied to a suite of samples from a traverse across a migmatitic shear zone in the Seiland Igneous Province, Northern Norway. Critically, changes in solid phase composition and CPO, and melt shape and orientation with respect to the wave propagation direction can result in huge variations in the same seismic property even if the melt fraction remains the same. A comparison with surface wave interpretations from tectonically active regions highlights the issues in current models used to predict melt percentages or partially molten regions. Interpretation of seismic data to infer melt percentages or extent of melting should, therefore, always be underpinned by robust modeling of the underlying geological parameters combined with examination of multiple seismic properties in order to reduce uncertainty of the interpretation.},

The relevant geophysical observations are outlined, and geotherms then obtained from parameterized convective models. Experimental observations which constrain the solidus and liquidus at various pressures are described by simple empirical functions. The variation in melt fraction is then parameterized by requiring a variation from 0 on the solidus to 1 on the liquidus.The composition of the melts is principally controlled by the melt fraction, though those of FeO, MgO, and SiO2 in addition vary with pressure. Another simple parameterization allows the observed compositions of major elements in 91 experiments to be calculated with a mean error of 1.1\%, and those of TiO2 and Na2O to 0.3\%. These expressions are then used to calculate the expected compositions of magma produced by adiabatic upwelling. The mean major element composition of the most magnesium-rich MORB glasses resemble the mean composition calculated for a mantle potential temperature Tp of 1280°C. Adiabatic melting during upwelling of mantle of this temperature generates a melt thickness of 7 km. The observed variations of the MgO and TiO2 concentrations in a large collection of MORB glass compositions suggest that extensive low pressure fractional crystallization occurs, but that its effect on the concentrations of SiO2, Al2O3, and CaO is small. There is no evidence that normal oceanic crust is produced from magmas containing more than 11\% MgO. The mantle potential temperature within hot rising jets is about 1480°C and can generate 27 km of magma containing 17\% MgO.Extension of the continental lithosphere generates little melt unless β\&gt; 2 and Tp\&gt; 1380°C. The melts generated by larger values of β or of Tp are alkali basalts, and change to tholeiites as the amount of melting increases. Large quantities of melt can be generated, especially at continental margins, where estimates of β obtained from changes in crustal thickness will in general be too small.},

	abstract = {Based on observations in both the laboratory and the Earth, we develop the hypothesis that plate boundaries are lubricated by networks of melt-rich shear zones. Such lubrication would serve to reduce effective strength and focus deformation at plates boundaries. This idea emerges from two sets of observations: (1) stress-driven melt segregation and organization in experimentally deformed mantle rocks and (2) seismic anisotropy patterns as observed at three divergent plate boundaries (the Ethiopian Rift, the Reykjanes Ridge, and the East Pacific Rise). In all three tectonic settings, the magnitude of anisotropy is greatest at the probable locations of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary within the plate boundary (“marginal LAB”). Seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is controlled by the lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of predominant olivine and the alignment of melt structures. The observed patterns of anisotropy are controlled by the dip angle of the marginal LAB. When steeply dipping, shear wave splitting in vertically traveling waves (e.g., SKS phases) is most sensitive to the alignment of melt, and surface waves should reveal faster Rayleigh wave velocities than Love wave velocities (VSV {\textgreater} VSH). When shallowly dipping, shear wave splitting in vertically traveling body waves is controlled by olivine LPO, and surface waves show faster Love wave velocities than Rayleigh wave velocities (VSV {\textless} VSH). The formation of melt-rich networks by stress-driven segregation should be most effective where strain rates are highest. These melt-lubricated shear zones will reduce effective viscosity relative to the direct extrapolation of viscosity values derived from laboratory creep experiments on homogenous samples. A composite model of anisotropic seismic properties is developed to test the hypothesis that melt segregates along the LAB, incorporating olivine fabrics with oriented and segregated melt over a range of length scales. This model is applied to observations from the three example plate boundaries, leaving the reader to speculate on the implications for interpretation of anisotropy patterns at other geodynamic settings.},

Pressures estimated from the Cr-in-clinopyroxene geobarometer and pseudosection modelling range from 1.0 to 2.1 GPa, which correspond to depths of 38–75 km. We used X-ray computed tomography to quantify the three-dimensional shape preferred orientation of spinel grains. Spinel displays dominantly oblate fabric ellipsoids, consistent with flattening strain. Olivine crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO), determined by electron backscatter diffraction, exhibits chiefly axial-[010] and A-type patterns. The axial-[010] CPO pattern is consistent with the spinel fabric that shows flattening strain, and is primarily developed in xenoliths from the volcanic center nearer to the NAFZ. Obliquity of olivine CPO to the spinel lineation decreases with proximity to the NAFZ, suggesting an increase in shear strain. Our results favor an interpretation of transpressional deformation in the upper mantle below the NAFZ. We attribute this pattern to a restraining bend in the mantle section of the NAFZ.},

These samples preserve the five olivine CPO types (A- through E-type) that rock deformation experiments have suggested are controlled by water content, temperature, stress magnitude, and pressure. The naturally deformed specimens newly investigated here (65 samples) and compiled from an extensive literature review (445 samples) reveal that these factors may matter less than deformation history and/or geometry. Some trends support those predicted by experimentally determined parametric dependence, but several observations disagree—namely, that all CPO types are able to form at very low water contents and stresses and that there is no clear relationship between water content and CPO type. This implies that at the low stresses typical of deformation in the mantle, CPO type more commonly varies as a function of strain geometry. Because olivine CPO is primarily responsible for seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle, the results of this study have several implications. These include (1) the many olivine CPO types recorded in samples from individual localities may explain some of the complex seismic anisotropy patterns observed in the continental mantle, and (2) B-type CPO—where olivine's “fast axes” align perpendicular to flow direction—occurs under many more conditions than traditionally thought. This study highlights the need for more experiments and the difficulty in using olivine CPO in naturally deformed peridotites to infer deformation conditions.},

	abstract = {Relating seismic anisotropy to mantle flow requires detailed understanding of the development and evolution of olivine crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). Recent experimental and field studies have shown that olivine CPO evolution depends strongly on the integrated deformation history, which may lead to differences in how the corresponding seismic anisotropy should be interpreted. In this study, two widely used numerical models for CPO evolution—D-Rex and VPSC—are evaluated to further examine the effect of deformation history on olivine texture and seismic anisotropy. Building on previous experimental work, models are initiated with several different CPOs to simulate unique deformation histories. Significantly, models initiated with a preexisting CPO evolve differently than the CPOs generated without preexisting texture. Moreover, the CPO in each model evolves differently as a function of strain. Numerical simulations are compared to laboratory experiments by Boneh and Skemer (2014). In general, the D-Rex and VPSC models are able to reproduce the experimentally observed CPOs, although the models significantly over-estimate the strength of the CPO and in some instances produce different CPO from what is observed experimentally. Based on comparison with experiments, recommended parameters for D-Rex are: M* = 10, λ* = 5, and χ = 0.3, and for VPSC: α = 10–100. Numerical modeling confirms that CPO evolution in olivine is highly sensitive to the details of the initial CPO, even at strains greater than 2. These observations imply that there is a long transient interval of CPO realignment which must be considered carefully in the modeling or interpretation of seismic anisotropy in complex tectonic settings.},

	abstract = {The influence of water and stress on the lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) of olivine aggregates was investigated through large strain, shear deformation experiments at high pressures and temperatures (P=0.5–2.1 GPa, T=1470–1570 K) under both water-poor and water-rich conditions. The specimens are hot-pressed synthetic olivine aggregates or single crystals of olivine. Water was supplied to the sample by decomposition of a mixture of talc and brucite. Deformation experiments were conducted up to γ (shear strain)∼6 using the Griggs apparatus where water fugacity was up to ∼ 13 GPa at the pressure of 2 GPa. The water content in olivine saturated with water increases with increasing pressure and the solubility of water in olivine at P=0.5–2 GPa was ∼ 400–1200 ppm H/Si. Several new types of LPO in olivine are found depending on water content and stress. Samples deformed in water-poor conditions show a conventional LPO of olivine where the olivine [100] axis is subparallel to the shear direction, the (010) plane subparallel to the shear plane (type-A). However, we identified three new types (type-B, C, and E) of LPO of olivine depending on the water content and stress. The type-B LPO of olivine which was found at relatively high stress and/or under moderate to high water content conditions is characterized by the olivine [001] axis subparallel to the shear direction, the (010) plane subparallel to the shear plane. The type-C LPO which was found at low stress and under water-rich conditions is characterized by the olivine [001] axis subparallel to the shear direction, the (100) plane subparallel to the shear plane. The type-E LPO which was found under low stress and moderate water content is characterized by the olivine [100] axis subparallel to the shear direction, the (001) plane subparallel to the shear plane. Observations by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show that the dislocations in water-poor samples (type-A) are curved and both b= [100] and b=[001] dislocations have a similar population. Numerous subgrains are seen in water-poor samples in backscattered electron images. In contrast, water-rich samples (both type-B and type-C) contain mostly b=[001] dislocations and dislocations are straight and sub-grain boundaries are rare compared to those in water-poor samples. These observations suggest that (1) dominant slip systems in olivine change with water fugacity (and stress) and (2) grain boundary migration is enhanced in the presence of water. Seismic anisotropy corresponding to the fabrics under water-rich condition is significantly different from that under water-poor condition. Consequently, the relationship between seismic anisotropy and flow geometry in water-rich regions is expected to be different from that in water-poor regions in which type-A fabric dominates (i.e., the lithosphere). A few cases are discussed including anisotropy in the subduction zone and in the deep upper mantle.},

Major breakthroughs have occurred in the study of lattice-preferred orientation in olivine during the past ∼10 years through large-strain, shear deformation experiments at high pressures. The role of water as well as stress, temperature, pressure, and partial melting has been addressed. The influence of water is large, and new results require major modifications to the geodynamic interpretation of seismic anisotropy in tectonically active regions such as subduction zones, asthenosphere, and plumes. The main effect of partial melting on deformation fabrics is through the redistribution of water, not through a change in deformation geometry. A combination of new experimental results with seismological observations provides new insights into the distribution of water associated with plume-asthenosphere interactions, formation of the oceanic lithosphere, and subduction. However, large uncertainties remain regarding the role of pressure and the deformation fabrics at low stress conditions.},

	abstract = {The lithospheric mantle is intrinsically heterogeneous and anisotropic. These two properties govern the repartition of deformation, controlling intraplate strain localization and development of new plate boundaries. Geophysical and geological observations provide clues on the types, ranges, and characteristic length scales of heterogeneity and anisotropy in the lithospheric mantle. Seismic tomography points to variations in geothermal gradient and hence in rheological behavior at scales of hundreds of km. Seismic anisotropy data substantiate anisotropic physical properties consistent at scales of tens to hundreds of km. Receiver functions imply lateral and vertical heterogeneity at scales b10 km, which might record gradients in composition or anisotropy. Observations on naturally deformed peridotites establish that compositional heterogeneity and Crystal Preferred Orientations (CPOs) are ubiquitous from the mm to the km scales. These data allow discussing the processes that produce/destroy heterogeneity and anisotropy and constraining the time scales over which they are active. This analysis highlights: (i) the role of deformation and reactive percolation of melts and ﬂuids in producing compositional and structural heterogeneity and the feedbacks between these processes, (ii) the weak mechanical effect of mineralogical variations, and (iii) the low volumes of ﬁne-grained microstructures and difﬁculty to preserve them. In contrast, olivine CPO and the resulting anisotropy of mechanical and thermal properties are only modiﬁed by deformation. Based on this analysis, we propose that strain localization at the plate scale is, at ﬁrst order, controlled by large-scale variations in thermal structure and in CPO-induced anisotropy. In cold parts of the lithospheric mantle, grain size reduction may contribute to strain localization, but the low volume of ﬁne-grained domains limits this effect.},

	abstract = {The impact of a mantle plume at the base of the Tanzania craton has modified the composition and seismic velocity of the lithospheric mantle. Lavas erupted by the Labait volcano have sampled the perturbed mantle from the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (N140 km) to the spinel-peridotite domain (b70 km). We have studied the microstructure, texture and seismic anisotropy of a set of xenoliths spanning these depths to investigate the effects of plume activity on the fabric and seismic properties of the lithospheric mantle. The microstructure changes with depth: first the grain-size increases significantly, and then nucleation recrystallization occurs. The deepest samples display a recrystallized equidimensional matrix embedding relicts of deformed paleoclasts. The crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of olivine remains clear and even tends to increase with depth. In most samples, the observed CPO is consistent with dominant activation of the (010)[100] slip system. Samples from the base of the lithosphere display more unusual CPO, suggesting increasing activity on the (010)[001] slip system. Nucleation recrystallization does not appear to modify the preexisting CPO, since neoblasts have a crystallographic orientation close to the parent grain orientation. Seismic properties remain similar over the whole section. In particular, no weakening of the seismic anisotropy is observed with depth, either for the P azimuthal or for the S polarization anisotropies. These results are consistent with previous seismological observations suggesting a coherent seismic anisotropy over the entire thickness of the Tanzania cratonic lithosphere. Our data thus provide new constraints for interpreting shear wave splitting measurements in East Africa, and support a model of perturbed lithosphere characterized by seismic signatures transitional between the bnormalQ lithosphere (for seismic anisotropy) and asthenosphere (for seismic velocities).},

	abstract = {Progress in seismic methodology and ambitious large-scale seismic projects are enabling high-resolution imaging of the continental crust. The ability to constrain interpretations of crustal seismic data is based on laboratory measurements on rock samples and calculations of seismic properties. Seismic velocity calculations and their directional dependence are based on the rock microfabric, which consists of mineral aggregate properties including crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO), grain shape and distribution, grain boundary distribution, and misorientation within grains. Single-mineral elastic constants and density are crucial for predicting seismic velocities, preferably at conditions that span the crust. However, high-temperature and high-pressure elastic constant data are not as common as those determined at standard temperature and pressure (STP; atmospheric conditions). Continental crust has a very diverse mineral composition; however, a select number of minerals appear to dominate seismic properties because of their high-volume fraction contribution. Calculations of microfabric-based seismic properties and anisotropy are performed with averaging methods that in their simplest form takes into account the CPO and modal mineral composition, and corresponding single crystal elastic constants. More complex methods can take into account other microstructural characteristics, including the grain shape and distribution of mineral grains and cracks and pores. Dynamic or active wave propagation schemes have recently been developed, which offer a complementary method to existing static averaging methods generally based on the use of the Christoffel equation. A challenge for the geophysics and rock physics communities is the separation of intrinsic factors affecting seismic anisotropy, due to properties of crystals within a rock and apparent sources due to extrinsic factors like cracks, fractures, and alteration. This is of particular importance when trying to deduce crustal composition and the state of deformation from seismic parameters.},

	abstract = {To constrain the deformation, thermal evolution, and seismic properties of the mantle lithosphere beneath the Hangay Dome, we have analyzed the microstructures, crystal preferred orientations (CPO), and hydrogen concentrations of olivine and pyroxenes of 50 mantle xenoliths carried up by Cenozoic basalts from Zala, Haer, and Shavaryn-Tsaram from Tariat, Mongolia. Most xenoliths are medium- to coarse-grained spinel-lherzolites, but four contain garnet + spinel. Coarse granular, highly annealed microstructures predominate. The microstructures are associated with well-developed CPO, typical of deformation under high temperature, moderate pressure, and dry conditions. The hydrogen concentrations in olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene are low and range around 5, 75, and 147 ppm H2O wt, respectively. Together, microstructures and CPO indicate that ductile deformation was followed by static recrystallization, which has annealed the microstructures but preserved the CPO and, hence, the anisotropy of physical properties. Lack of correlation between annealing and equilibrium temperatures suggest that the annealing is due to a long quiescence episode since the last deformation episode. Here, there is not evidence that the formation of Hangay Dome is associated with recent deformation in the lithospheric mantle. Calculated seismic properties show moderate seismic anisotropy, with fast propagation of P waves and polarization of S waves parallel to the flow direction and low birefringence for S waves propagating obliquely to the flow plane. The results are consistent with weak P wave anomalies but not with the strong low S wave velocity anomalies predicted by some tomographic models or with the high conductivity inferred from magnetotelluric data for the lithospheric mantle beneath the Hangay Dome.},

The models consider a variety of types of anisotropy and heterogeneity where the emphasis is to ascertain whether or not travel-times can be used to discriminate between the existence of partial melt and anisotropy. Two mechanisms for anisotropy in the upwelling asthenosphere are considered: one due to the preferential alignment of the fast axes of olivine crystals in the direction of mantle flow and the other due to the preferential alignment of cracks that feed melt towards the spreading axis. The results indicate that P-waves are most sensitive to even modest amounts of flowinduced asthenospheric anisotropy, while S-waves are most sensitive to the presence of mantle melt. Multiple S-wave arrivals are predicted for many models, most notably the ones with anisotropy due to crack-alignment where very large S-wave separations develop. The model which best fits existing data requires a higher degree of crystal-alignment anisotropy in the upwelling-asthenosphere than in the lithosphere. This effect has been predicted in studies of the evolution of crystal-alignment anisotropy in polycrystalline aggregates.},

The model consists of solid grains, which make a framework through grain-to-grain contact, and an interstitial liquid phase. Contiguity is the essential geometric factor that determines the macroscopic mechanical properties of the granular composites, while the other factors such as liquid volume fraction affect the properties only indirectly through the contiguity. Contiguity is defined by the portion of the grain surface being in contact with the neighboring grains, and takes a value between 0 and 1. Total length of the solid-solid and solid-liquid phase boundaries observed in cross section can be quantitatively related to the contiguity. Contiguity ϕ can be extended to a tensor ϕij to cover anisotropic grain contact. The full anisotropic macroscopic elasticities are quantitatively derived as functions of contiguity. Also, as an attempt to apply the present formulation to viscous behaviors of solid-liquid composites, bulk and shear viscosities are derived as functions of contiguity. The results successfully predict the large structural sensitivities of these properties; the bulk and shear moduli (or viscosities) of the skeleton are drastically reduced by decreased contiguity and vanish when contiguity vanishes. For partially molten media under thermodynamic equilibrium, geometrical variation according to melt fraction and dihedral angle is quantitatively related to the variation of contiguity, and the acoustic properties are derived as functions of melt fraction and dihedral angle.},

	abstract = {We investigate seismic wave velocity reduction resulting from the presence of partial melt in the upper mantle. The amount of shear and bulk modulus reduction produced by the presence of a connected network of realistically shaped and naturally organized melt inclusions is found using finite element calculations. The geometries of the inclusions are taken directly from laboratory experiments of mantle melting, with finite element meshes constructed to conform to these shapes. The shear and bulk moduli of the composite material are found for both the unrelaxed (isolated inclusions) and relaxed (pressure equalized inclusions) cases by assigning appropriate material properties to the fluid. Modulus reduction from deformation simulations of a solid containing realistically shaped and ellipse-shaped melt inclusions quantify the effect of melt pocket cuspateness and melt pocket organization on seismic velocity reduction. The three-dimensional response is estimated from two-dimensional distributions of the melt phase by determining the mode II and mode III components of elastic modulus reduction separately and summing their effects. In general, cuspate and naturally organized melt inclusions cause greater velocity reduction. It is shown that VP and VS reduction per percent partial melt are at least 3.6\% and 7.9\%, respectively. Even higher values for velocity reduction are possible above 1\% melt fraction if melt exists only in tubules below 1\% melt fraction. The lower, more conservative values of velocity reduction are ∼70\% greater for VP and 84\% greater for VS than the analytically determined values for ellipsoidal inclusions. Somewhat greater effects are possible if nonrandom organization of melt occurs on scales greater than our model.},

	abstract = {Crystal orientation mapping experiments typically measure orientations that are similar within grains and misorientations that are similar along grain boundaries. Such (mis)orientation data cluster in (mis)orientation space, and clusters are more pronounced if preferred orientations or special orientation relationships are present. Here, cluster analysis of (mis)orientation data is described and demonstrated using distance metrics incorporating crystal symmetry and the density-based clustering algorithm {DBSCAN}. Frequently measured (mis)orientations are identified as corresponding to similarly (mis)oriented grains or grain boundaries, which are visualized both spatially and in three-dimensional (mis)orientation spaces. An example is presented identifying deformation twinning modes in titanium, highlighting a key application of the clustering approach in identifying crystallographic orientation relationships and similarly oriented grains resulting from specific transformation pathways. A new open-source Python library, orix, that enabled this work is also reported.},
